# Logistic Regression

> Inspite of the name Logistic regression, Its used for classification and not for regression tasks

- Logistic Regression is yet another simple, yet more powerful, algorithm for linear and binary classification problems.
- It's a classification model that is very easy to implement and performs very well on linearly separable classes.
- Here we are actually interested in predciting the probability that a certain example belongs to a particular class, which is the inverse form of the logit function. It is also called `Logistic Sigmoid Function`.
- The difference between adaline and logistic regression is that Adaline uses linear activation function and logistic regression uses Sigmoid.
